# Authentic Performance versus Modern Performance of music by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach #

## Portfolio Herma Ardesch ##

Raised in an environment in which Bach's music was predominant, I learned to play the flute and developed a preference for the music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788) and his ‘Empfindsame Stil’ with many unexpected melodic and harmonic turns to symbolize mood swings. My corpus consists of flute concertos, cello concertos, trio sonatas and symphonies. 

My research question is: **Is it possible to detect differences between authentic and modern performance in the music of C.Ph.E. Bach in this corpus, using the Spotify API?** I expect differences in tempo, interpretation, instrumental sound, pitch, valence and energy between authentic and modern performance practices. Of course I need to give extra attention to the pitch of both groups, since authentic instruments usually play in a different tuning, resulting in a lower pitch. 

Typical tracks to compare in my portfolio are: the Andante and Allegro II of C.Ph.E. Bach’s Flute Concerto in A minor, Wq 166 in the authentic performance of Konrad Hünteler with the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra (Ton Koopman) and the modern performance of Emmanuel Pahud with the Kammerakademie Potsdam (Trevor Pinnock). Both performances take a different tempo, energy level and pitch and the wooden baroque traverso has quite a different sound character, compared to the modern silver or golden Böhm-flute. 

However, I expect that since the inception of the authentic performance practice over half a century ago, both authentic and modern performances have grown closer to eachother, because of improved replicas of authentic instruments on the one hand and a greater versatility of instrumentalists playing both authentic and modern versions of their instrument.
